# Docs

Use this docs hub as the source of truth for project context and delivery artifacts.

## Start Here
- `docs/REPO-STRUCTURE.generated.md` shows the scaffolded docs structure for this repo.
- `docs/learnings.md` is append-only and captures durable engineering learnings.
- `docs/04-projects/README.md` explains dossier conventions for active work.

## Conventions
- Keep docs small, current, and scoped.
- Prefer links to source material over duplicated prose.
- Move stale work to `docs/99-archive/` rather than deleting context.
