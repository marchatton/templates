# Projects

Work items live under lane folders in `docs/04-projects/`.

## Lanes
- `02-features/` for feature work
- `03-fixes/` for bug fixes and incidents

## Dossier Naming
Use lane-local numeric IDs and a kebab-case slug:
- `0001_<slug>/`

## Minimum Dossier Content
- `prd.md` and `prd.json`
- `reviews/` for review notes (optional)
- `tmp-oracle/` and `tmp-handoffs/` for generated artifacts
