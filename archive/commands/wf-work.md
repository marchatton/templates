# Work Plan Execution Command

Execute a work plan efficiently while maintaining quality and finishing features.

## Introduction

This command takes a work document (plan, specification, or todo file) and executes it systematically. The focus is on **shipping complete features** by understanding requirements quickly, following existing patterns, and maintaining quality throughout.

## Input Document

<input_document> #$ARGUMENTS </input_document>

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Quick Start

1. **Read Plan and Clarify**

   - Read the work document completely
   - Review any references or links provided in the plan
   - If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions now
   - Get user approval to proceed
   - **Do not skip this** - better to ask questions now than build the wrong thing

2. **Setup Environment**

   **Standard workflow:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
   - Confirm the target branch and repo state before making changes
   - Avoid extra working directories by default; use a single working copy unless the user requests otherwise

3. **Create Todo List**
   - Create a task checklist in the response
   - Include dependencies between tasks
   - Prioritize based on what needs to be done first
   - Include testing and quality check tasks
   - Keep tasks specific and completable

### Phase 2: Execute

1. **Task Execution Loop**

   For each task in priority order:

   ```
   while (tasks remain):
     - Mark task as in_progress in the checklist
     - Read any referenced files from the plan
     - Look for similar patterns in codebase
     - Implement following existing conventions
     - Write tests for new functionality
     - Run tests after changes
     - Mark task as completed
   ```

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**

   - The plan should reference similar code - read those files first
   - Match naming conventions exactly
   - Reuse existing components where possible
   - Follow project coding standards (see AGENTS.md)
   - When in doubt, grep for similar implementations

3. **Test Continuously**

   - Run relevant tests after each significant change
   - Don't wait until the end to test
   - Fix failures immediately
   - Add new tests for new functionality

4. **Figma Design Review** (if applicable)

   For UI work with Figma designs:

   - Implement components following design specs
   - Compare key screens against the design (spacing, typography, colors, states)
   - Fix visual differences identified
   - Repeat until implementation matches design

5. **Track Progress**
   - Keep TodoWrite updated as you complete tasks
   - Note any blockers or unexpected discoveries
   - Create new tasks if scope expands
   - Keep user informed of major milestones

### Phase 3: Quality Check

1. **Run Core Quality Checks**

   Always run before submitting:

   ```bash
   # Run full test suite (adapt to your project)
   bin/rails test    # Rails
   pnpm test         # Node/JS
   cargo test        # Rust

   # Run linting (per AGENTS.md)
   ```

2. **Optional Reviewer Pass** (Optional)

   Use for complex, risky, or large changes:

   - **code-simplicity-reviewer**: Check for unnecessary complexity
   - **kieran-rails-reviewer**: Verify Rails conventions (Rails projects)
   - **performance-oracle**: Check for performance issues
   - **security-sentinel**: Scan for security vulnerabilities

   Present findings to user and address critical issues.

3. **Final Validation**
   - All checklist tasks marked completed
   - All tests pass
   - Linting passes
   - Code follows existing patterns
   - Figma designs match (if applicable)
   - No console errors or warnings

### Phase 4: Ship It

1. **Create Commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git status  # Review what's being committed
   git diff --staged  # Check the changes

   # Commit with conventional format
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   feat(scope): description of what and why

   Brief explanation if needed.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

2. **Capture and Upload Screenshots for UI Changes** (REQUIRED for any UI work)

   For **any** design changes, new views, or UI modifications, you MUST capture and upload screenshots:

   **Step 1: Start dev server** (if not running)
   ```bash
   bin/dev  # Run in background
   ```

   **Step 2: Capture screenshots with agent-browser CLI**
   ```bash
   agent-browser open http://localhost:3000/[route]
   agent-browser snapshot -i
   agent-browser screenshot output.png
   ```
   See the `agent-browser` skill for detailed usage.

   **Step 3: Upload screenshots**
   - Use your team's preferred host or attachment flow
   - If no upload tool is available, provide local file paths and ask how to share

   **What to capture:**
   - **New screens**: Screenshot of the new UI
   - **Modified screens**: Before AND after screenshots
   - **Design implementation**: Screenshot showing Figma design match

   **IMPORTANT**: Always include uploaded image URLs in PR description. This provides visual context for reviewers and documents the change.

3. **Create Pull Request**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch-name

   gh pr create --title "Feature: [Description]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   - What was built
   - Why it was needed
   - Key decisions made

   ## Testing
   - Tests added/modified
   - Manual testing performed

   ## Before / After Screenshots
   | Before | After |
   |--------|-------|
   | ![before](URL) | ![after](URL) |

   ## Figma Design
   [Link if applicable]
   EOF
   )"
   ```

4. **Notify User**
   - Summarize what was completed
   - Link to PR
   - Note any follow-up work needed
   - Suggest next steps if applicable

## Key Principles

### Start Fast, Execute Faster

- Get clarification once at the start, then execute
- Don't wait for perfect understanding - ask questions and move
- The goal is to **finish the feature**, not create perfect process

### The Plan is Your Guide

- Work documents should reference similar code and patterns
- Load those references and follow them
- Don't reinvent - match what exists

### Test As You Go

- Run tests after each change, not at the end
- Fix failures immediately
- Continuous testing prevents big surprises

### Quality is Built In

- Follow existing patterns
- Write tests for new code
- Run linting before pushing
- Use reviewer agents for complex/risky changes only

### Ship Complete Features

- Mark all tasks completed before moving on
- Don't leave features 80% done
- A finished feature that ships beats a perfect feature that doesn't

## Quality Checklist

Before creating PR, verify:

- [ ] All clarifying questions asked and answered
- [ ] All TodoWrite tasks marked completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Figma designs match implementation (if applicable)
- [ ] Before/after screenshots captured and uploaded (for UI changes)
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] PR description includes summary, testing notes, and screenshots

## When to Use Reviewer Agents

**Don't use by default.** Use reviewer agents only when:

- Large refactor affecting many files (10+)
- Security-sensitive changes (authentication, permissions, data access)
- Performance-critical code paths
- Complex algorithms or business logic
- User explicitly requests thorough review

For most features: tests + linting + following patterns is sufficient.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Analysis paralysis** - Don't overthink, read the plan and execute
- **Skipping clarifying questions** - Ask now, not after building wrong thing
- **Ignoring plan references** - The plan has links for a reason
- **Testing at the end** - Test continuously or suffer later
- **Forgetting TodoWrite** - Track progress or lose track of what's done
- **80% done syndrome** - Finish the feature, don't move on early
- **Over-reviewing simple changes** - Save reviewer agents for complex work
