# Review Command

<command_purpose> Perform exhaustive code reviews with structured analysis, clear findings, and actionable todo capture. </command_purpose>

## Introduction

<role>Senior Code Review Architect with expertise in security, performance, architecture, and quality assurance</role>

## Prerequisites

<requirements>
- Git repository with GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Clean main/master branch
- For document reviews: Path to a markdown file or document
</requirements>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Determine Review Target & Setup (ALWAYS FIRST)

<review_target> #$ARGUMENTS </review_target>

<thinking>
First, I need to determine the review target type and set up the code for analysis.
</thinking>

#### Immediate Actions:

<task_list>

- [ ] Determine review type: PR number (numeric), GitHub URL, file path (.md), or empty (current branch)
- [ ] Check current git branch
- [ ] If ALREADY on the PR branch → proceed with analysis on current branch
- [ ] If DIFFERENT branch → checkout the PR branch (via `gh pr checkout` or `git checkout`)
- [ ] Fetch PR metadata using `gh pr view --json` for title, body, files, linked issues
- [ ] Set up language-specific analysis tools
- [ ] Prepare security scanning environment
- [ ] Make sure we are on the branch we are reviewing. Use gh pr checkout to switch to the branch or manually checkout the branch.

Ensure that the code is ready for analysis on the target branch. ONLY then proceed to the next step.

</task_list>

#### Review Lenses (run sequentially)

Apply each lens and capture findings with file/line references:

- Correctness & edge cases
- Security & data safety
- Performance & scalability
- Architecture & maintainability
- Testing & observability
- UX/DX (errors, logs, supportability)

#### Conditional Checks (when applicable)

**If PR contains database migrations (db/migrate/*.rb files) or data backfills:**

- Validate ID/enum mappings match production reality (prevents swapped values)
- Check for orphaned associations and backfill safety
- Confirm dual-write and rollback strategy if needed
- Provide pre/post-deploy SQL verification queries

**When to run migration checks:**
- PR includes files matching `db/migrate/*.rb`
- PR modifies columns that store IDs, enums, or mappings
- PR includes data backfill scripts or rake tasks
- PR changes how data is read/written (e.g., changing from FK to string column)
- PR title/body mentions: migration, backfill, data transformation, ID mapping

### 4. Ultra-Thinking Deep Dive Phases

<ultrathink_instruction> For each phase below, spend maximum cognitive effort. Think step by step. Consider all angles. Question assumptions. And bring all reviews in a synthesis to the user.</ultrathink_instruction>

<deliverable>
Complete system context map with component interactions
</deliverable>

#### Phase 3: Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Put yourself in each stakeholder's shoes. What matters to them? What are their pain points? </thinking_prompt>

<stakeholder_perspectives>

1. **Developer Perspective** <questions>

   - How easy is this to understand and modify?
   - Are the APIs intuitive?
   - Is debugging straightforward?
   - Can I test this easily? </questions>

2. **Operations Perspective** <questions>

   - How do I deploy this safely?
   - What metrics and logs are available?
   - How do I troubleshoot issues?
   - What are the resource requirements? </questions>

3. **End User Perspective** <questions>

   - Is the feature intuitive?
   - Are error messages helpful?
   - Is performance acceptable?
   - Does it solve my problem? </questions>

4. **Security Team Perspective** <questions>

   - What's the attack surface?
   - Are there compliance requirements?
   - How is data protected?
   - What are the audit capabilities? </questions>

5. **Business Perspective** <questions>
   - What's the ROI?
   - Are there legal/compliance risks?
   - How does this affect time-to-market?
   - What's the total cost of ownership? </questions> </stakeholder_perspectives>

#### Phase 4: Scenario Exploration

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Explore edge cases and failure scenarios. What could go wrong? How does the system behave under stress? </thinking_prompt>

<scenario_checklist>

- [ ] **Happy Path**: Normal operation with valid inputs
- [ ] **Invalid Inputs**: Null, empty, malformed data
- [ ] **Boundary Conditions**: Min/max values, empty collections
- [ ] **Concurrent Access**: Race conditions, deadlocks
- [ ] **Scale Testing**: 10x, 100x, 1000x normal load
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Timeouts, partial failures
- [ ] **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory, disk, connections
- [ ] **Security Attacks**: Injection, overflow, DoS
- [ ] **Data Corruption**: Partial writes, inconsistency
- [ ] **Cascading Failures**: Downstream service issues </scenario_checklist>

### 4. Simplification and Minimalism Review

Do a simplicity pass to identify unnecessary complexity and potential reductions.

### 5. Findings Synthesis and Todo Creation Using file-todos Skill

<critical_requirement> ALL findings MUST be stored in the docs/todos/ directory using the file-todos skill. Create todo files immediately after synthesis - do NOT present findings for user approval first. Use the skill for structured todo management. </critical_requirement>

#### Step 1: Synthesize All Findings

<thinking>
Consolidate all agent reports into a categorized list of findings.
Remove duplicates, prioritize by severity and impact.
</thinking>

<synthesis_tasks>

- [ ] Collect findings from all review lenses and tools
- [ ] Categorize by type: security, performance, architecture, quality, etc.
- [ ] Assign severity levels: 🔴 CRITICAL (P1), 🟡 IMPORTANT (P2), 🔵 NICE-TO-HAVE (P3)
- [ ] Remove duplicate or overlapping findings
- [ ] Estimate effort for each finding (Small/Medium/Large)

</synthesis_tasks>

#### Step 2: Create Todo Files Using file-todos Skill

<critical_instruction> Use the file-todos skill to create todo files for ALL findings immediately. Do NOT present findings one-by-one asking for user approval. Create all todo files in one pass using the skill, then summarize results to user. </critical_instruction>

**Implementation Approach:**

- Create todo files directly using the template
- Batch all findings in one pass (no per-finding approvals)
- Follow naming convention: `{issue_id}-pending-{priority}-{description}.md`

**Execution Strategy:**

1. Create each finding as a todo file:
   - Add acceptance criteria and work log

2. Use file-todos skill for structured todo management:

   ```bash
   skill: file-todos
   ```

   The skill provides:

   - Template location: `skills/utilities/file-todos/assets/todo-template.md`
   - Naming convention: `{issue_id}-{status}-{priority}-{description}.md`
   - YAML frontmatter structure: status, priority, issue_id, tags, dependencies
   - All required sections: Problem Statement, Findings, Solutions, etc.

3. Create todo files for each finding:

   ```bash
   {next_id}-pending-{priority}-{description}.md
   ```

4. Examples:

   ```
   001-pending-p1-path-traversal-vulnerability.md
   002-pending-p1-api-response-validation.md
   003-pending-p2-concurrency-limit.md
   004-pending-p3-unused-parameter.md
   ```

5. Follow template structure from file-todos skill: `skills/utilities/file-todos/assets/todo-template.md`

**Todo File Structure (from template):**

Each todo must include:

- **YAML frontmatter**: status, priority, issue_id, tags, dependencies
- **Problem Statement**: What's broken/missing, why it matters
- **Findings**: Discoveries with evidence/location
- **Proposed Solutions**: 2-3 options, each with pros/cons/effort/risk
- **Recommended Action**: (Filled during triage, leave blank initially)
- **Technical Details**: Affected files, components, database changes
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable checklist items
- **Work Log**: Dated record with actions and learnings
- **Resources**: Links to PR, issues, documentation, similar patterns

**File naming convention:**

```
{issue_id}-{status}-{priority}-{description}.md

Examples:
- 001-pending-p1-security-vulnerability.md
- 002-pending-p2-performance-optimization.md
- 003-pending-p3-code-cleanup.md
```

**Status values:**

- `pending` - New findings, needs triage/decision
- `ready` - Approved by manager, ready to work
- `complete` - Work finished

**Priority values:**

- `p1` - Critical (blocks merge, security/data issues)
- `p2` - Important (should fix, architectural/performance)
- `p3` - Nice-to-have (enhancements, cleanup)

**Tagging:** Always add `code-review` tag, plus: `security`, `performance`, `architecture`, `rails`, `quality`, etc.

#### Step 3: Summary Report

After creating all todo files, present comprehensive summary:

````markdown
## ✅ Code Review Complete

**Review Target:** PR #XXXX - [PR Title] **Branch:** [branch-name]

### Findings Summary:

- **Total Findings:** [X]
- **🔴 CRITICAL (P1):** [count] - BLOCKS MERGE
- **🟡 IMPORTANT (P2):** [count] - Should Fix
- **🔵 NICE-TO-HAVE (P3):** [count] - Enhancements

### Created Todo Files:

**P1 - Critical (BLOCKS MERGE):**

- `001-pending-p1-{finding}.md` - {description}
- `002-pending-p1-{finding}.md` - {description}

**P2 - Important:**

- `003-pending-p2-{finding}.md` - {description}
- `004-pending-p2-{finding}.md` - {description}

**P3 - Nice-to-Have:**

- `005-pending-p3-{finding}.md` - {description}

### Review Lenses Applied:

- correctness
- security
- performance
- architecture
- testing/observability

### Next Steps:

1. **Address P1 Findings**: CRITICAL - must be fixed before merge

   - Review each P1 todo in detail
   - Implement fixes or request exemption
   - Verify fixes before merging PR

2. **Triage All Todos**:
   ```bash
   ls docs/todos/*-pending-*.md  # View all pending todos
   /triage                  # Use slash command for interactive triage
   ```
````

3. **Work on Approved Todos**:

   ```bash
   /resolve_todo_parallel  # Fix all approved items efficiently
   ```

4. **Track Progress**:
   - Rename file when status changes: pending → ready → complete
   - Update Work Log as you work
   - Commit todos: `git add docs/todos/ && git commit -m "refactor: add code review findings"`

### Severity Breakdown:

**🔴 P1 (Critical - Blocks Merge):**

- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption risks
- Breaking changes
- Critical architectural issues

**🟡 P2 (Important - Should Fix):**

- Performance issues
- Significant architectural concerns
- Major code quality problems
- Reliability issues

**🔵 P3 (Nice-to-Have):**

- Minor improvements
- Code cleanup
- Optimization opportunities
- Documentation updates

### 7. End-to-End Testing (Optional)

<detect_project_type>

**First, detect the project type from PR files:**

| Indicator | Project Type |
|-----------|--------------|
| `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift` (iOS) | iOS/macOS |
| `Gemfile`, `package.json`, `app/views/*`, `*.html.*` | Web |
| Both iOS files AND web files | Hybrid (test both) |

</detect_project_type>

<offer_testing>

After presenting the Summary Report, offer appropriate testing based on project type:

**For Web Projects:**
```markdown
**"Want to run browser tests on the affected pages?"**
1. Yes - run `/test-browser`
2. No - skip
```

**For iOS Projects:**
```markdown
**"Want to run Xcode simulator tests on the app?"**
1. Yes - run `/xcode-test`
2. No - skip
```

**For Hybrid Projects (e.g., Rails + Hotwire Native):**
```markdown
**"Want to run end-to-end tests?"**
1. Web only - run `/test-browser`
2. iOS only - run `/xcode-test`
3. Both - run both commands
4. No - skip
```

</offer_testing>

#### If User Accepts Web Testing:

Run browser tests using available tooling (`/test-browser` if present, otherwise agent-browser/Playwright):

1. Identify pages affected by the PR
2. Navigate each page and capture snapshots
3. Check for console errors
4. Test critical interactions
5. Pause for human verification on OAuth/email/payment flows
6. Create P1 todos for any failures
7. Fix and retry until all tests pass

**Standalone (if available):** `/test-browser [PR number]`

#### If User Accepts iOS Testing:

Run Xcode simulator tests using available tooling (`/xcode-test` if present, otherwise xcodebuild):

1. Discover project and schemes
2. Build for iOS Simulator
3. Install and launch app
4. Take screenshots of key screens
5. Capture console logs for errors
6. Pause for human verification (Sign in with Apple, push, IAP)
7. Create P1 todos for any failures
8. Fix and retry until all tests pass

**Standalone (if available):** `/xcode-test [scheme]`

### Important: P1 Findings Block Merge

Any **🔴 P1 (CRITICAL)** findings must be addressed before merging the PR. Present these prominently and ensure they're resolved before accepting the PR.
