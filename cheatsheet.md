### develop
- `bug-reproduction-validator`: Use this agent when you receive a bug report or issue description and need to verify whether the reported behavior is actually a bug. This agent will attempt to reproduce the issue systematically, validate the steps to reproduce, and confirm whether the behavior deviates from expected functionality. <example>\\nContext: The user has reported a potential bug in the application.\\nuser: \"Users are reporting that the email processing fails when there are special characters in the subject line\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the bug-reproduction-validator agent to verify if this is an actual bug by attempting to reproduce it\"\\n<commentary>\\nSince there's a bug report about email processing with special characters, use the bug-reproduction-validator agent to systematically reproduce and validate the issue.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n<example>\\nContext: An issue has been raised about unexpected behavior.\\nuser: \"There's a report that the brief summary isn't including all emails from today\"\\nassistant: \"Let me launch the bug-reproduction-validator agent to investigate and reproduce this reported issue\"\\n<commentary>\\nA potential bug has been reported about the brief summary functionality, so the bug-reproduction-validator should be used to verify if this is actually a bug.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>
- `pr-comment-resolver`: Use this agent when you need to address comments on pull requests or code reviews by making the requested changes and reporting back on the resolution. This agent handles the full workflow of understanding the comment, implementing the fix, and providing a clear summary of what was done. <example>Context: A reviewer has left a comment on a pull request asking for a specific change to be made.user: \"The reviewer commented that we should add error handling to the payment processing method\"assistant: \"I'll use the pr-comment-resolver agent to address this comment by implementing the error handling and reporting back\"<commentary>Since there's a PR comment that needs to be addressed with code changes, use the pr-comment-resolver agent to handle the implementation and resolution.</commentary></example><example>Context: Multiple code review comments need to be addressed systematically.user: \"Can you fix the issues mentioned in the code review? They want better variable names and to extract the validation logic\"assistant: \"Let me use the pr-comment-resolver agent to address these review comments one by one\"<commentary>The user wants to resolve code review feedback, so the pr-comment-resolver agent should handle making the changes and reporting on each resolution.</commentary></example>

Produces a concrete pre/post-deploy checklist with SQL verification queries, rollback procedures, and monitoring plans. Essential for risky data changes where you need a Go/No-Go decision. <example>Context: The user has a PR that modifies how emails are classified. user: \"This PR changes the classification logic, can you create a deployment checklist?\" assistant: \"I'll use the deployment-verification-agent to create a Go/No-Go checklist with verification queries\" <commentary>Since the PR affects production data behavior, use deployment-verification-agent to create concrete verification and rollback plans.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user is deploying a migration that backfills data. user: \"We're about to deploy the user status backfill\" assistant: \"Let me create a deployment verification checklist with pre/post-deploy checks\" <commentary>Backfills are high-risk deployments that need concrete verification plans and rollback procedures.</commentary></example>

### review
- `agent-native-architecture`: Build applications where agents are first-class citizens. Use this skill when designing autonomous agents, creating MCP tools, implementing self-modifying systems, or building apps where features are outcomes achieved by agents operating in a loop.
- `agent-native-audit`: This skill should be used when running a comprehensive agent-native architecture audit with scored principles.
- `agent-native-reviewer`: Use this agent when reviewing code to ensure features are agent-native - that any action a user can take, an agent can also take, and anything a user can see, an agent can see. This enforces the principle that agents should have parity with users in capability and context. <example>Context: The user added a new feature to their application.\\nuser: \"I just implemented a new email filtering feature\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the agent-native-reviewer to verify this feature is accessible to agents\"\\n<commentary>New features need agent-native review to ensure agents can also filter emails, not just humans through UI.</commentary></example><example>Context: The user created a new UI workflow.\\nuser: \"I added a multi-step wizard for creating reports\"\\nassistant: \"Let me check if this workflow is agent-native using the agent-native-reviewer\"\\n<commentary>UI workflows often miss agent accessibility - the reviewer checks for API/tool equivalents.</commentary></example>
- `architecture-strategist`: Use this agent when you need to analyze code changes from an architectural perspective, evaluate system design decisions, or ensure that modifications align with established architectural patterns. This includes reviewing pull requests for architectural compliance, assessing the impact of new features on system structure, or validating that changes maintain proper component boundaries and design principles. <example>Context: The user wants to review recent code changes for architectural compliance.\\nuser: \"I just refactored the authentication service to use a new pattern\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the architecture-strategist agent to review these changes from an architectural perspective\"\\n<commentary>Since the user has made structural changes to a service, use the architecture-strategist agent to ensure the refactoring aligns with system architecture.</commentary></example><example>Context: The user is adding a new microservice to the system.\\nuser: \"I've added a new notification service that integrates with our existing services\"\\nassistant: \"Let me analyze this with the architecture-strategist agent to ensure it fits properly within our system architecture\"\\n<commentary>New service additions require architectural review to verify proper boundaries and integration patterns.</commentary></example>

- `data-migration-expert`: Use this agent when reviewing PRs that touch database migrations, data backfills, or any code that transforms production data. This agent validates ID mappings against production reality, checks for swapped values, verifies rollback safety, and ensures data integrity during schema changes. Essential for any migration that involves ID mappings, column renames, or data transformations. <example>Context: The user has a PR with database migrations that involve ID mappings. user: \"Review this PR that migrates from action_id to action_module_name\" assistant: \"I'll use the data-migration-expert agent to validate the ID mappings and migration safety\" <commentary>Since the PR involves ID mappings and data migration, use the data-migration-expert to verify the mappings match production and check for swapped values.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user has a migration that transforms enum values. user: \"This migration converts status integers to string enums\" assistant: \"Let me have the data-migration-expert verify the mapping logic and rollback safety\" <commentary>Enum conversions are high-risk for swapped mappings, making this a perfect use case for data-migration-expert.</commentary></example>
