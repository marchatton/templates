# Brief

## Purpose

Start shaping with a concise `brief.md`.

## Inputs

- Problem, why now, evidence, success.
- Appetite/timebox + constraints.
- Goals + non-goals.
- In/out scope (perimeter).
- Key flows + links (breadboard, risks, spikes).
- Top risks + unknowns.
- Open questions.
- If missing, use `ask-questions-if-underspecified`.

## Workflow

1) Read any existing brief + inputs.
2) Draft `brief.md` using `../breadboarding/references/templates/brief-template.md`.
3) Keep 1-2 pages. Link out instead of dumping details.
4) Ensure: problem alignment, goals/non-goals, perimeter, de-scope, risks/unknowns (<=10), open questions (<=10), shaping decision placeholder.
5) Return updated `brief.md`.

## Output

- `brief.md`
