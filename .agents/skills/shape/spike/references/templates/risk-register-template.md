# Risk register (rabbit holes)

Use this during shaping to capture tail risks and choose mitigations.

| ID | Rabbit hole | Type | Why it’s risky | Mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RH1 |  | technical / design / dependency / data |  | patch / out-of-bounds / cut / spike | open / spiked / patched / cut |

## Notes

- Prefer writing rabbit holes as questions.
- If a rabbit hole is really a product decision, treat it as a shaping question (don’t hide it as “tech risk”).
