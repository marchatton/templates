# Risks & rabbit holes notes (Shape Up Ch 5)

This chapter is about removing tail risk *before* betting on the work.

## Thin-tailed vs fat-tailed

- Well-shaped work has a tight confidence interval: it might run a bit long, but it shouldn’t explode.
- Rabbit holes create fat tails: one unknown can multiply the schedule.

## How to find rabbit holes

- Slow down after the breadth-first sketching phase.
- Walk through a real use case in slow motion.
- Ask viability questions:
  - is any part new technical work?
  - are there hidden interdependencies?
  - are assumptions being made about how parts fit together?
  - is a hard decision being deferred to the team under deadline?

## How to remove the tail

Pick one or more moves:

- **Patch a hole** by dictating a compromise that keeps the core value while removing uncertainty.
- **Declare out of bounds** to prevent “helpful” scope expansion.
- **Cut back** non-essential excitement that adds risk.
- **Present to technical experts** early, in a lightweight way.
  - Don’t ask “is it possible?”
  - Ask “is it possible within the appetite?”
  - Keep the clay wet: redraw the concept together and invite revisions.
