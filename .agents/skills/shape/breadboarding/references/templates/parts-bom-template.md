# Parts list (BOM)

Write parts as buildable chunks. Include deletes.

| Part | Name | Mechanism | Touch points | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 |  | <1–2 line summary of how it works> | <files/components/routes/services> | <trade-offs, scope cuts> |

## Notes

- Keep parts scoped to behaviour, not tasks.
- Prefer 6–10 top-level parts.
- If a part needs more precision, split it into F3.1, F3.2… with nested bullets below the table.
